#### *What is this about?*
In this post, I walk through the use of saliency maps to visualize the decision-making process of a neural network model. 
#### *Why should I care?*
Neural networks are often considered to be black-box models, whose decisions are made behind a mysterioius veil. While their 
decision making process can indeed be complex, its not all hidden to us, and saliency maps are here to help make sense of it. 
#### *Want to learn more?*
This blog post is awesome, but you'll learn a lot more from a book than from me... If you're interested in learning more about 
computer vision, check out these books:
