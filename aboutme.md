My name is Brad Sliz. I live near Chicago, IL, where I work as a data scientist. I have specifically been focused on computer vision applications for the automatic detection of damage on cars. I have a Masters degree from Northwestern University in Predictive Analytics, and undergraduate degrees from the University of Illinois (Civil Engineering) and Eastern Illinois University (Engineering Physics). I enjoy spending time with my family, making open source software, cooking, gardening, basketball, and tennis.
